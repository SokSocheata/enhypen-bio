            Enhypen, a new boy group from Mnet’s survival show “I-Land,” is slated to make its highly anticipated debut
            in November. With excitement building around these rising superstars, we have profiled the seven musicians
            to get an idea of what to expect from them. Yang finished first on “I-Land” during the final round, and his
            best strengths are dancing and singing. Despite his comparatively short trainee period, he succeeded in
            impressing the show’s judges, including Bang, with his outstanding performance.

        <p>Enhypen, a new boy group from Mnet’s survival show “I-Land,” is slated to make its highly anticipated debut
            in November. It’s only been a few weeks since the multinational seven-piece band put up its first official
            profile, but this sensational rookie act has already attracted the spotlight.
        </p>
        <p>Initially, the high-profile show -- jointly organized by South Korean entertainment giant CJ ENM and Big Hit
            Entertainment, home to BTS and TXT -- had a rough start due to extremely low ratings and a series of
            controversies. However, backed by its undeniably powerful global fandom, Enhypen emerged as a force to be
            reckoned with. The group’s Twitter account racked up over 710,000 followers within two days of its launch.
            On Big Hit’s online fan community Weverse, Enhypen followers already outnumber TXT followers and are second
            in number only to BTS followers. </p>
        <p>Just like its predecessors, Enhypen is expected to present a world-building narrative and youth-oriented
            stories. “Throughout the audition, the bandmates have connected two opposite worlds as trainees and artists.
            The group’s name fits well into their future roles, which is to connect, discover and grow with each other,”
            explained Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk.</p>
